## relcondition function
## this function estimates a growth curve from a data set of lengths and weights and then calculates relative condition,
## based on Le Cren (1951) Kr = W/Wˆ, where Wˆ is the predicted body weight from the length−weight relationship
## Le Cren ED (1951) The length-weight relationship and seasonal cycle in gonad weight and condition in the perch (Perca fluviatilis). J Anim Ecol 20:201−219
